# Punnett-Square-Generator

This program was created around September-October of 2019 after having ~3 months of experience using Java. Given user input about a certain trait (ie. inheritance type and allele variations), the program uses 2D arrays and object-oriented programming to generate the corresponding Punnett Square. 

## MonoHybrid

When entering the information pertaining to a single trait, a monohybrid cross is produced. The program will also ask for the inheritance type (complete domiance, incomplete dominance, co-dominance, or x-linked) and provide the genotype and phenotype ratios.

## PolyHybrid

This program allows the user to specify and enter as many traits as they would like, and will then produce the Punnett Square, but will not give the genotype and phenotype ratios.
